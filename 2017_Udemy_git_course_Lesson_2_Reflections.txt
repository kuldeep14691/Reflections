What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans: Initializing a repository simply means to convert a simple windows directory to git directory. If we think about this conversion it 
just would be creating the the basic  git set up files in that repository. These setup files are required to handle the commands/operations
which we usually perform on git repo/directory.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
Ans- Merging combines changes of 2 copies of a file in on final copy which can be used as a resultant.
It gives user a broad understanding at entire repository level


What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
Ans-Automatic merge is not good:
	- There could be dependency in changes being done, auto merge would mess it up

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
Ans Working directory contains all files which you have changed after last checkout
	However staging area contains only those files which you will add through git add command for next commit
	As per my understanding next commit would only consider the files added to staging area. It would ignore other
	changes not added to staging area.

What value do you think it offers?
Ans No idea

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Ans No idea

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Ans- Branch is a copy of you current repository, which is made just to avoid any jumbelsale in you head repository. 
I mean to say while doing changes if there any messy things happens in your branch it atleast won't corrupt you core git repository. 
You can again checkout you repository to new branch.
Also it gives user additional layer to finally review verify the changes before committing to git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans- 
Staging area & Working directory both initially contains the most recent commit which is done in repository.
Then user first adds his change to working directory, till this point staging area would contain the recent commit code not the working directory copy
Then user adds his change to staging area for commit
	At this point Working directory & staging area both would contain same source
Working directory contains all files which you have changed after last checkout
	However staging area contains only those files which you will add through git add command for next commit
	As per my understanding next commit would only consider the files added to staging area. It would ignore other
	changes not added to staging area.
Once user commits change it make working directory/Straging area/Repository all in sync
Compare working directory with Staging area- 
	User can run GIT DIFF without any parameter for this
Compare Staging are with repository-
	Use command git diff -staged (this will show all the differences in staging area and repository)
